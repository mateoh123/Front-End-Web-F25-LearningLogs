  <h3>Website Development Inspiration:</h3>
  <p>
    My two biggest recent inspirations are the portfolios of Alexander Vilinskyy
    and Patrick David. Both are web developers in their own regard. When it
    comes to creating my own work, I struggle with balancing maximalism and
    minimalism. On the outside, I present myself as very minimal, but in
    actuality, I have a lot of thoughts going on, and that really reflects in my
    work.

  <p>
    Alexandars portfolio has a very basic color scheme, which I enjoy, while
    Patrick Davids work is fun. It's animated, it's silly, but still structured.

    I looked over these specfic articles; to reaffirm what I already knew about
    HTML/CSS. But it never hurts to look over the basic again.
