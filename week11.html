  <h3>Audit Midterm for Accessibility</h3>
  <p>
    My Midterm Project got a 6/10 in terms of accessibility, which is WAY higher
    than I originally expected. The brunt of the issues was the missing alt text
    in my images. Since my website is very image heavy that makes complete
    sense. The other issues were navigation and lack of text, but those are more
    so issues ill resolve when I figure out the content on the page. Alt text
    although, I can fix!
