    Throughout this semester, my understanding of web design and development has
    evolved from basic HTML and CSS into a more thoughtful process of visual
    storytelling. At this point, I’ve learned how much design choices in code
    can affect how fashion and media are perceived online. The “Advanced
    Positioning” article from Interneting is Hard helped me realize how layering
    and positioning can be used creatively, not just functionally, to build
    editorial-style layouts that echo the look of magazine spreads. I now
    understand how relative and absolute positioning can let me overlap text,
    photography, and textures to evoke the feeling of a fashion editorial page.
    Which was helpful, especially for making the layered folders. Meanwhile, the
    God of code help; W3Schools helped with responsive viewports. A design that
    feels immersive on desktop should still capture attention on mobile, so I'm
    planning on making sure the website is responsive moving forward.

    My journey so far has been one of balancing aesthetics with technical
    structure. When I first started my website, I focused mainly on visuals,
    large photos, bold color palettes, and typography, but the layouts often
    broke on smaller screens. As I learned more about responsive design, I began
    to see my site as a living, adaptive portfolio rather than a static page.
    Implementing techniques like media queries and flexible layouts helped me
    achieve a balance between creative freedom and usability. Drawing from the
    lessons in Interneting is Hard, this process has deepened my respect for
    digital fashion presentation, showing me how interactivity and design
    precision can enhance storytelling in the same way that photography or
    styling does.

    To stay inspired and productive, I plan to keep exploring the intersection
    of design, fashion, and technology. I’ll experiment with new CSS techniques
    like hover transitions and scroll-triggered animations to simulate the
    feeling of motion seen in lookbooks.

  <h3>Essay Response</h3>
  <p>
    I think what made this essay somewhat compelling is that it isn't just about
    code; Ford also weaves in the history and culture that came with
    human-centered coding. He frames code and shows how programming languages,
    compilers, frameworks, and infrastructure all layer on top of fundamental
    instructions. I learned how programming is woven into the structure of
    modern life, from the systems that run our computers to tech companies. But
    thinking about this article in the AI era, the piece feels dated. Ford wrote
    about programmers as translators between humans and machines, but now, AI
    tools can generate and interpret code themselves, so everything "knows how
    to code." Besides that, I thought the user experience was really fun, when
    you look past the really distracting background that kept distracting me.
    All the interactive aspects really did keep me engaged. However, looking at
    the article overall it didnt really resonate with me that much, beyond
    linking some concepts together. I did find it a good read though.
