    I used these two articles alot, when adding the breakpoints to my created
    Craigslist website. When it came to adding the media queries I was confused
    as to whether or not to use min-width or max-width. The Mozilla width helped
    me clear this up, also helped me realized, when creating the Craigslist
    website; is that you need an overall media queries for your lower media
    queries to work. Which confused me; cause I'd imagine that the lower media
    queries would still work. Overall adding media queries doesnt seem too
    difficult, and isnt too difficult and it just comes down to planning.
