    From both articles, I learned that it’s best to animate properties like
    transforms and opacity for smoother performance, and that
    animation-fill-mode can control how an element behaves after the animation
    ends. Overall I think these articles were pretty good at helping me
    understand how the animations work; and kinda showing me the creative and
    technical sides that can exist within web development. Not everything needs
    to be static.
