    I REALLY loved this read so much. I've been designing websites for quite a
    while up until this point; and I feel like im so deep in that everything I
    do feels so stupid at times. Constant uneeded buzzwords, to describe simply
    things. \'Advanced'/ terms no one asked about. I completely forget how to
    just design with simplicity. The Blur Test, the hate for dropdowns, law of
    locality. All such simple ideas that are so often forgotten to even make the
    basic of any UI. Its good to be reminded.
